For my lab1 assignment I created a new field called 'BIPOC_PCT' (percentage of people of color in a given county). I first created a field called 'BIPOC_POP' which adds up the total population of all non-white groups listed in the file, including 'mixed' and 'other'. I chose to create the BIPOC_PCT field because I was interested in displaying how diverse different counties in California are. Further, I think this type of diversity scale can be very informative when compared to other state-wide indicators such as wealth, emplyoyment, environmental pollutants, public investment in infrastructure, etc. One potential problem this dataset might have is undercounting of rural/migrant farm workers/undocumented folks -- populations who have traditionally been left out or who have reasonable fear to be counted in official statistics.
