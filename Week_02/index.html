            <p>Bienvenidos a mi portafolio virtual! Mi nombre es Anny, and I am a graduate student in <a href="https://ph.ucla.edu/academics/departments/community-health-sciences">Community Health Sciences at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health</a>. I spend most of my time drinking tea, daydreaming about food, and plotting the demise of the capitalist, colonial, and neoliberal structures that keep the global majority poor, sick, and hungry. I came back to graduate school after having worked in the fields of international development and global health for a few years because I want to use my platform as a researcher to uplift the calls for liberation and equity in health globally. I am excited to use the tools of critical cartography to continue working toward this goal! </p>
            <p>I had the chance to get started on my mapping journey last year when I took a course with the amazing Dr. Yoh Kawano on spatial data sciece. I was amazed and excited to learn about the power of mapping and data science to mobilize resources+attention to the issues that matter. <a href="https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/33acb1e6dfe447fd9fbfb866e836db38">you can see my final project for that course</a> :o)</p>
