            <p>Bienvenidos a mi portafolio virtual! Mi nombre es Anny, and I am a graduate student in Community Health Sciences at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. I spend most of my time drinking tea, daydreaming about food, and plotting the demise of the capitalist, colonial, and neoliberal structures that keep the global majority poor, sick, and hungry. I came back to graduate school after having worked in the fields of international development and global health for a few years becuase I want to use my platform as a researcher to uplift the calls for liberation and equity in health globally. I am excited to use the tools of critical cartography to continue working towards this goal! </p>
